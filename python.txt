cgi - common gateway interface. For this we need a web server which process some webserver apps
we can then use this web server ip to 
configure yum using the df -h command to check the dvd info
/run/media/himanshu/RHEL-8-0-0-BaseOS-x86_64
add this inside etc/yum.repos.d
create a file as himan.rep and add the AppStream and BaseOs details as
[dvd1]
baseurl=file:///run/media/root/RHEL.xx/AppStream
gpgcheck=0

[dvd2]
baseurl=file:///run/media/root/RHEL.xx/BaseOS
gpgcheck=0

yum repolist 
yum install httpd
systemctl restart httpd

to get the cgi facility. by default already enable on this apache. If you need to run the code inside 
add your code /var/www/cgi-bin

cd /var/www/html

1. /var/www/cgi-bin
2. chmod +x
3. #!/usr/bin/python3
4. Content-Type - This is to tell browser to check the content and print what we've in the code

so complete code will be

#!/usr/bin/python3

print("content-type: text/html")
print()

x=5
print(x)

print("Hello api")
